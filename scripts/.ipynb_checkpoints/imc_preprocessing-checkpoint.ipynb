    "**This pipeline is used to segment IMC data using ilastik pixel classification and CellProfiler.**\n",
    "It allows conversion of IMC raw data (MCD files) into standardized OME-TIFF files. From this the files are processed via a combination of customized CellProfiler modules and supervised machine learning as implemented with Ilastik, allowing a state-of-the-art image segmentation and single cell feature extraction. The segmented single cell data can then be exported for direct use in HistoCAT or HistoCAT++ software as well as customized statistical data analysis scripts based on R or Python.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - a `full` column (*csv_pannel_full variable*) containing a 1 for each metal that should be included in the analysis,\n",
    "    - an `ilastik` column (*csv_pannel_ilastik*) which specifies which metals should be used as a basis for ilastik pixel classification,\n",

    "\n",
    "This step will segment the probabilities into masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to adapt:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) File list: choose again all files from the `tiffs` folder\n",
    "\n",
    "2) It is important to check the `IdentifyPrimaryObjects` step, if the segmentation settings are suitable!\n",
    "    This might vary strongly between cell/tissue/training and needs attention! Use the test mode and try various settings.\n",
    "    Also note the `smooth` step immediately before: This can be also removed, I just happen get good results with this additional step.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Also the `MeasureObjectSizeShape` combined with `FilterObjects` is just some personal preference of mine, feel free to change\n",
    "\n",
    "4) `IdentifySecondaryObjects`: Here th mask is expanded to the full cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) `Rescale objects`: note that our segmentation was done on 2x upscaled images, this scales the masks down again. Note that potentially also the nuclei mask could be scaled down and further exported and used.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) The `Default Output Path` does not need to be adapted for this module.\n",

    "- In this pipeline all the intesities are scaled by `1/(2**16)`\n",
    "- The mapping between channel number c1, c2, c3 corresponds to the position in the `_full.csv`s found in the `tiffs` folder.\n",
    "- The original acquisition description, acquisition frequencies etc can be found in the `Image.csv` output as `Metdata_...` columns.\n",
    "- This outputs a lot of measurements that are acutally of little interest - usually we only look at `meanintensity` per channel and cell.\n",
    "    To reduce the outputs, select in `Export To Spreadsheet` -> `Select Measurements to Export` -> Only the measurements you want (usually all Image measurements and only the `MeanIntensity` fullstack measurements).\n",
    "- The `FullStack` can also be not measured, as it is almost identical to the `FullStackFiltered`.\n",

    "7) `CorrectSpilloverApply`: This will generate a corrected image stack, this can be used e.g. to do measurements of intensity distribution. For measurements of intensity it is however better to correct the measurement afterward using the `CorrectSpilloverMeasurement`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) `CorrectSpilloverMeasurement`: Here the intensity measurement can be spillover corrected. Note that this makes only sense for linear combinations of intensity measurements such as `MeanIntensity` or `TotalIntensity`. For these it is more accurate to do this after measurement than doing it on the pixel level beforehand. Note that for things with non linear transformations as `MedianIntensity`, this will not result in valid results and these measurements should be done on beforehand corrected images from `CorrectSpilloverApply`."
