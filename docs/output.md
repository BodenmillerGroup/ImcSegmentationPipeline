# The output of the IMC segmentation pipeline

Note that the `description` image name can be found in the `..._Acquisition_meta.csv` generated together with the ome tiffs
as well as in the `cpinp` folder later in the script.
After analysis the `Image.csv` metadata file generated in Cellprofiller will also contain the `Description` as well as other important metadata for each
image, such as acquisition frequency, time, location etc.
